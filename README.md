Android Wear Heartbeat Monitor Client for Web App used for Streaming Service Overlay.
Project is implemented as an android application that connects to a website so android wear device can be used without need for a "companion app" on a mobile device.

Android application is currently setup to connect to my personal website (modesto.io/heart), which is currently hardwired to a single client. Planned client-based unique pages to be implemented as application is released.
Part of the server-sided requirements are implemented and the android device is blind to this client system.
Automatically generates a unique URL on the device, which will be properly linked in the website.

Fully functional, tested during streams, feature-completeness is dependent on server-sided features.
